# These are my personal solutions to Advent of Code 2023
You can find the solutions in the different branches for each day. Development is meant as a clean starting point for each day.  
I have used typescript for all the solutions. I have commited non-refactored code, it's messy. Did it this way so I could get on with the next day quicker.
